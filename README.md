# Fundamentals-of-Deep-Learning-HFU

This repository was created for the course MME 26849: "Fundamentals of Deep Learning and TinyML". I worked as an Assistant Course Instructor, where I was in charge of structuring this course content, assignments, projects, and developing this code base for topics such as Support Vector Machines, Single/Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, Hyper-parameter Tuning, Pruning, and Quantization.
